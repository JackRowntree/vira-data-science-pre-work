    "Now you have a basic understanding of the data, the next step is to **build a simple 1 page dashboard that summarises the key characteristics of the datasets**.  \n",
    "\n",

    "- How to aggregate the 3 datasets into one data structure (e.g. a database) that can be queried (with your chosen programming language) \n",
    "- What exhibits to display\n",
    "- How to transform the data for the selected exhibits\n",
    "- How to host the dashboard (note: the dashboard does not require a public URL, you can demo on your local machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To help simplify this task, please use the following guidelines:\n",
    "- Stick to a 1 page layout and do not try and prepare more than 6 exhibits \n",
    "- Don't worry about 'perfect' styling - we understand this can take a lot of time and we're most interested in your overall approach and the core components of your implementation \n",
